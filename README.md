# Public Health Inference System

## Overview

This repository contains the **individual assignment** for *Programming for Artificial Intelligence*.  
The project implements a **Rule-Based Public Health Inference System** that allows users to create, update, and delete public-health scenarios and to infer health outcomes using deterministic logic.

The system emphasises **explainability**, **reproducibility**, and **database-driven analytics** without reliance on external APIs or CSV datasets.
